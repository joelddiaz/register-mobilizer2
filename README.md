# register-mobilizer2

## What it does

This extension uses the webRequest API to rewrite URLs from http://*theregister.co.uk to http://m.theregister.co.uk so that the mobile version of theregister is automatically loaded.

This is a port of the original register-mobilizer to use the new Firefox WebExtensions APIs.
